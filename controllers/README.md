/**
 * Controllers Directory
 * 
 * This directory contains controller functions that handle the business logic
 * for each route. Controllers interact with models and return responses.
 * 
 * Example structure:
 * - sweetController.js - CRUD operations for sweets
 * - categoryController.js - Category management
 * - userController.js - User management
 * 
 * Controllers follow the pattern:
 * - Receive request from routes
 * - Process business logic
 * - Interact with models
 * - Send response back to client
 * 
 * All controllers will be created following TDD principles.

// Controllers will be added here following TDD approach
